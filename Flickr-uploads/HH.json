Over the years, both the width and thickness (strength) of mainsprings has been measured in different ways on various gauges, ranging from brass or steel plates with notches of various sizes cut in them for measuring the width, and narrowly tapered slots for measuring the thickness or strength. In later times micrometers were used, which more accurately measured in hundredths of a millimetre. The correct thickness of a spring also had to relate to the diameter of the barrel into which it fitted, to give the correct number of turns per day to the barrel. \n \n Part of the Applied Arts and Design collection. \n \n Credit Line: Collection of Auckland Museum T&#257maki Paenga Hira, 2004.44.28 \n \n For more details visit <a href=\"http://www.aucklandmuseum.com/collections-research/collections/record/am_humanhistory-object-13669\">www.aucklandmuseum.com/collections</a>  \n \n Images released under a CC-BY licence.

This entailed drilling a fine central hole into the end of the shaft for fitting a new piece of steel tightly into it. This was then shaped and polished as a new pivot. Of recent years this would be done in a watchmakers lathe, but in earlier times it was done using specially designed tools such as this, or a larger tool known as a Jacot tool.
